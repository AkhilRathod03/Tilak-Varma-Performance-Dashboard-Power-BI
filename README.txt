Welcome to your Interactive Cricket Player Dashboard!

This folder contains a fully automated system for generating a performance dashboard for the selected player.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Prerequisites (One-Time Setup):**
    You need to have Python installed on your system. If you do, you may need to install a couple of libraries that are used to create the data and the dashboard. Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) and run the following commands:
    
    pip install pandas
    pip install plotly

2.  **Generate the Dashboard:**
    Simply double-click the `run.bat` file located in this folder. A command window will appear and run a script.

3.  **View the Dashboard:**
    Once the script is finished, two new files will appear in this folder:
    - `player_data.csv`: The raw data generated for the player.
    - `dashboard.html`: The interactive dashboard file.

    Double-click `dashboard.html` to open it in your default web browser.

**FILES:**

- `run.bat`: The script you run to generate everything.
- `create_dashboard.py`: The Python script that contains all the logic for data generation and dashboard creation.
- `README.txt`: This file.
